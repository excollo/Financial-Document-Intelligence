# DRHP vs RHP Comparative Analysis - Fund Manager Perspective

## 🎯 Core Objective
As a **Senior Fund Manager** conducting pre-IPO due diligence, analyze the DRHP vs RHP to identify changes that materially impact **investment thesis, valuation, risk profile, and portfolio fit**.

---

## 📋 CRITICAL FUND MANAGER FOCUS AREAS

### 1. 💰 VALUATION & PRICING DYNAMICS
**What to Extract:**
- Price band changes (floor vs cap)
- Issue size variations (fresh issue + OFS splits)
- Pre/post-money valuation shifts
- Dilution impact on existing shareholders
- Price-to-earnings vs comparable companies
- Any discount/premium to book value changes
- Basis of issue price determination modifications

**Analysis Required:**
```
| Metric                    | DRHP      | RHP       | Variance % | Impact Rating |
|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Price Band                |           |           |            |               |
| Issue Size (₹ Cr)         |           |           |            |               |
| Fresh Issue               |           |           |            |               |
| OFS                       |           |           |            |               |
| Post-Issue Market Cap     |           |           |            |               |
| P/E Ratio                 |           |           |            |               |
| P/B Ratio                 |           |           |            |               |
```

**Red Flags:**
- Price band reduction >15%

### 3. 💸 USE OF PROCEEDS - CAPITAL ALLOCATION SCRUTINY

**Track Changes In:**
- Allocation buckets (capex, debt repayment, acquisitions, working capital, general corporate)
- Percentage allocation shifts
- New categories added/removed

- Any vague "general corporate purposes" increases

**Fund Manager Questions:**
- Is capital being used for growth or balance sheet repair?
- Does the allocation support the investment thesis?
- Are growth projects clearly defined with ROI metrics?
- Is debt repayment % too high (distressed indicator)?

**Output Format:**
```
| Use Category              | DRHP (₹ Cr) | DRHP % | RHP (₹ Cr) | RHP % | Change | Impact |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Capex (Specific Project)  |             |        |            |       |        |        |
| Debt Repayment            |             |        |            |       |        |        |
| Working Capital           |             |        |            |       |        |        |
| General Corporate         |             |        |            |       |        |        |
| Acquisition               |             |        |            |       |        |        |

**⚠️ Red Flag Indicators:**
- "General Corporate Purposes" > 30%
- Debt repayment > 50% (unless clearly articulated strategy)
- Capex allocation reduced significantly
